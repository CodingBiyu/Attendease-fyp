## 🧠 System Architecture


## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Lecturer** logs into the system and generates a **QR code** with GPS-locked coordinates.
2. **Student** scans the QR code from the projector screen using the mobile app.
3. Student enters the **OTP** generated by the system.
4. System validates:
   - Student identity
   - GPS location (within allowed radius)
   - OTP correctness
5. Upon validation, **attendance is marked** and saved to the database.
6. **Admin and faculty** can view logs and generate **attendance reports**.
